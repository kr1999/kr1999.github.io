       <h1> ABOUT KEERTHANA </h1>
       <p> Hellooo! My name is Keerthana Routhu, and I'm a rising
       senior at Irvington High School.  The first time that
       I learned any kind of programming was in my seventh grade
       computer class.  The teacher taught us how to build a website
       using HTML, and I thought it was pretty interesting.  Then, that
       summer, I tried learning Python online, but I had lost all interesting
       in programming at that point.</p>
       
      
      <p> In eighth grade, I joined my school's robotics team
      and my interest in any sort of programming increased a little,
      leading me to join an all girls programming club in my freshman
      year of high school.  I got accepted into COSMOS at UCSC
      the summer after my junior year, and I learned how to program
      a robot using the C programming language.  My interest in programming
      is at an all time high now, as I think it is very fun and would
      definitely love to learn more.</p>
      
      <p> I will now talk a little more about myself, beyond my interest
      in programming.  I love birds.  During my time at COSMOS, there
      used to be a bird that flew into my dorm everyday.  After seeing
      it fly in a couple of times each day, I started leaving it the 
      sunflower seeds that my mom had packed for me.  It started coming
      more frequently after that.  It knew exactly how to fly in and out -- 
      it would never fly into the window to try to get out.  It was 
      a smart little thing, but, unfortunately, it will not have any 
      sunflower seeds waiting for it everyday. </p>
      
      <p> I have a goof for a younger sister.  She and I get along
      most of the time, but sometimes we go for each other's
      blood when we are angry at each other.  Luckily, for our parents,
      this happens very rarely, and most of the time, we are very 
      loving (in our own ways) to each other.  We do weird variations
      of gymnastics that she calls "acrostunts."  Once, when we were
      doing acrostunts together, she fell on top of my face and farted!
      Worst experience ever, honestly.  I hope that never happens again. </p>
      
      <p> I will now move onto talking about what I have been doing each day
      after COSMOS has ended.  I need a way to track my productivity,
      otherwise, I won't be productive at all.  <link rel = "Keerthana's Days" a href = "index2.html"> </p>
